# UFOs Challenge 

## Overview 

In this project we were given a data set with UFO sightings. In order to make these more user friendly to read and search through, we used Javascript and html to create an interactive webpage with search bars. 

## Results 

On the left-hand side of the page, you will find 5 search bars. In the back end we have connected these to the data so we can filter based on date, city, state, country or shape. See below of two examples where we filtered the data. The first we filtered by the city El Cajon and the second we filtered by the state AR. 

## Summary 

One drawback in the design is that there is not a way to refresh the filters. Once I have entered search terms in each of the left-hand bars, I must delete all 5 to get the full original table data. My first recommendation to improve this page would be to add a refresh button. This can be added with another function in the app.js file. My second recommendation is to add a scraping process to bring in new sightings data. Right now, this only includes those in January of 2010, but there may be more that people have reported since.
